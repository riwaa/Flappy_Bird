# This project used python to recreate the game flappy bird

`run flappy_bird.py to start the game`

The program utilized the object oriented programing. The base class is `item` class which can load in any object and with a method to render the item to screen. I then used inheritance to create child class such as `bird` and `obstical`. These class inherit methods from `item`, but also has additional methods or attributes unique to them. Finally, `game_engine` class combineds all these pieces of classes together into the final game.

## Enjoy the ludicrous mode!!!
